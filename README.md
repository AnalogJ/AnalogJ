### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Devops/Automation guy, focused on building tools that help you automate & manage your servers. If you use [letsencrypt/certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot) you've probably used [lexicon](https://github.com/AnalogJ/lexicon) (which they depend on), a tool & library that lets you interact with DNS providers in a standardized way. [Scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) is a Hard Drive health dashboard & monitoring solution, merging manufacturer provided S.M.A.R.T metrics with real-world failure rates.
You can check my Pinned repos below for other popular projects I've built. 

I'm currrently working on a project called [Fasten Health](https://github.com/fastenhealth/fasten-onprem) - it's an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator, designed to integrate with 10,000's of insurances/hospitals/clinics
