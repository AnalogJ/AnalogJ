### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Devops/Automation guy, focused on building tools that help you automate & manage your servers. If you use [letsencrypt/certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot) you've probably used [lexicon](https://github.com/AnalogJ/lexicon) (which they depend on), a tool & library that lets you interact with DNS providers in a standardized way.
You can check my Pinned repos below for other popular projects I've built. 

I'm currrently working on a project called Scrutiny. Scrutiny is a Hard Drive health dashboard & monitoring solution, merging manufacturer provided S.M.A.R.T metrics with real-world failure rates. Here's a screenshot:

My current goal is to reach [25 Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/AnalogJ/), at which point I plan on open sourcing Scrutiny. So if you'd like to kick the tires (& support open source developers like myself) please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/AnalogJ/).
